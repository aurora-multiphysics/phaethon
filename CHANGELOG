# CHANGELOG

## v1.0.0 (2022-03-11)

First functioning prototype!

### Added

- The functionality of driving ASCOT5 over multiple times steps, which required
  a fairly involved process copying many variable from the endstate to the marker
  group. This completes the first Phaethon prototype. It should now be possible to
  incorporate Phaethon as a sub-app that ties into a heat conduction problem,
  where fluxes provided to the heat conduction problem are from the fast ions.

### Changed

- Some of the test data had to be updated and corrected, and the testing of the
  HDF5 data produced by ASCOT5 streamlined to handle the more numerous comparisons
  needed.

## v0.3.0 (2021-11-08)

### Added

- Ability to obtain heat flux values from an ASCOT5 run. These values are stored in an AuxVariable that is available to MOOSE.

## v0.2.0 (2021-10-06)

Obligatory release for STEP cycle.

### Added

- No changes from previous version.

## v0.1.0 (2021-08-13)

First release of PHAETHON.

### Added

- Docker build and development system
- ASCOT5 and Python bindings build in Ubuntu 20.04-based Docker image along with PHAETHON MOOSE source
- Ability to read HDF5 files produced by ASCOT5 and get particle energies and wall tile hits
